#  Availability on various platforms

The system is to be available (at CERN) on many sorts of machine, but
priorities must be decided. A list comprises:

  * A unix or VMS workstation with X-windows 
  * An 80 character terminal attached to a unix or VMS machine, or an MSDOS PC 
  * An 80 character terminal attached to an IBM mainframe running VM/CMS 
  * A Macintosh 
  * A unix workstation with NextStep 
  * An MS-DOS/Windows PC 

The order above does not imply a priority. It may be that the implementation
on one system will lead more easily to an implementation on one of the others,
and this would in practice change the order of porting. The requirement for 80
column terminals to be useable (emphasized by M. Goossens) follows from low
budgets of many of our users.

The order of implementation of special browsers at CERN is a function of what
manpower available.
