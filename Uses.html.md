#  Intended Uses

Here are some of the many areas in which hypertext is used. Each area has its
specific requirements in the way of features required.

  * General reference data - encyclopaedia, etc. 
  * Completely centralized publishing - online help, documentation, tutorial etc 
  * More or less centralized dissemination of news which has a limited life 
  * Collaborative authoring 
  * Collaborative design of something other than the hypertext itself 
  * Personal notebook 

The CERN requirement has a mixture of many of these uses, except that there is
not a requirement for distribution of fixed hypertext on hard media such as
optical disk. Evidently, the system will have to be networked, though
databases may start life at least as personal notebooks.

For looking up data bases, the user should be able to refer to already
prepared complex queries by simple UDIs. A moe advanced user should also be
able to prepare a complex query himself, store it (interpreted language!) in
his local filing space, and use it through a simple UDI.

[The (paper) document "HyperText and CERN" describes the problem to be solved
at CERN, and the requirements of a system which solves them. That information
is not repeated here.]
